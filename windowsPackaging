These are the steps for creating a packaged version for Windows.

Build OS: Windows 7 64 bit

* Download and install Python-2.7 (64 bit version)
	* Download from [here](python.org/downloads)
	* Make sure to set the "Add to path"-option during install
* Download and install PyWin32 (64 bit version)
	* Download from [here](github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases)
* Download Microsoft C++ Redistributables
	* vcredist_x86.exe (why not x64_86?)
	* Install
* Install dependencies from Christoph Gohlkes archive
	* Download packages from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
	* Numpy
	* OpenCV 2.4
	* zmq
	* VTK 5.10
	* PyQt4
	* Pillow
	* pyserial
	* Install each of them using pip install <package-name>
* Install pyInstaller using pip -install pyinstaller
* Add paths to C:\Python27\Libs\site-packages\vtk / Qt4 etc to PATH
* Better (????): Add path to C:\Python27\Libs\site-packages to PATH

* Modify C:\Python27\Libs\PyInstaller\hooks\hook-pythonvtk.py to C:\Python27\Libs\site-packages\PyInstaller\hooks\hook-vtk.py and comment last two lines of C:\Python27\Libs\site-packages\vtk\__helper.py
according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21835851/python-executable-with-vtk-pyinstaller-py2exe-cx-freeze-etc) Otherwise vtk will not be imported correctly during packaging

* Finally, run pyinstaller --onefile monkeyprint.py from monkeyprint directory
* Copy monkeyprint.exe from the dists/monkeyprint folder to the base dir and delete dists and build folders
* monkeyprint.exe is ready to ship
